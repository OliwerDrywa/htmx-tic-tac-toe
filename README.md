i started with php + htmx, attempting to create some realtime app either using websockets or SSE

i realized php is a really poor choice for both websockets and SSE, i am now using go

go's templating is probably good enough for many websites but i'm going for a lot of animations and using websockets which means i'd have to create lots of templates and for that it might be nice to use a nicer templating engine like templ

templ was a mistake... it's not supported enough
